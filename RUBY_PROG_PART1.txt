RUBY PROGRAMMING BASICS :
------------------------

Checking ruby version: Open cmd > Ruby -v 

Gems : Gems are synonymous to jar files in Java and help us to intstall libraries 

Some of the commands are :

gem list --local : Gives us a list of all the gems installed on our pc 
gem install gemName : Installs the particular gem on our PC .
gem uninstall gemName: Uninstalls the gem from our pc .
gem fetch gemName: Downloads the gem only but does not install.

How to run Ruby scripts ?
--------------------------

RULE :  Always save the files as FileName.rb  ( the .rb is an extension to save ruby files)

Type1: If you are using an IDE like Eclipse or RubyMine simply save and run 

Type2: If you are using any text editor like SublimeText or Notepad++ then :

Step1: Go to the directory where your ruby file is saved (i.e the FileName.rb)
Step2 :  Open cmd 
Step3: Type in the command : ruby FileName.rb 
Step4: Press enter 


PRINTING STATEMENTS :
-------------------
 
We can print statements using the following commands :

>puts : Prints a new line 
>print : does not print a new line 


Example :                    

puts 'First Line'
print'Second Line'
puts 'Third Line' 


Output:>

First Line                                     ===============>prints a new line 
Second LineThird Line


USING COMMENTS IN YOUR RUBY FILE :
=================================

SINGLE LINE COMMENT : Single Line comments are made using the #

Example :

#We are printing a comment here 

MULTI LINE COMMENT : Multi Line comments 

Example :

=begin

This is a multi line comment line 1
This is a multi line comment line 2

=end 

READ INPUT FROM USER :
=====================

method1: USING gets 

EXAMPLE :
puts " Enter your name"
name = gets 
puts "The name is "+ name 

method2: using gets.chomp

For string :

name = gets.chomp

for integer :

integer = gets.chomp.to_i

for float :

float =gets.chomp.to_f


THINGS TO NOTE WHILE PRINTING VALUES CONTAINED IN VARIABLES / CONCATENATION ISSUES IN RUBY :
===========================================================================================

1> Whenever we store a string value in any variable we can easily concatenate with puts : For eg:

puts "Enter the values of name"
name= gets.chomp
puts "The name is"+name 
[We can easily concatenate the value contained in the var called name with the contents of puts in "  "]


2> For INTEGER & FLOAT values we cannot conatenate for that we use something called as INTERPOLATION . For eg:

puts "Enter the integer value"
int = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "The value of integer is #{int}"     ===============>CORRECT OUTPUT 


However if we write :
puts "The valus of integer is" +int          ====================>INCORRECT OUTPUT


BLOCK IN RUBY :
==============

In ruby we have two blocks mainly the BEGIN & END .

Whatever we write in the BEGIN block that will get executed first 
Whatever we write in the END  block that will get executed last 


BEGIN {

Code written here will be execute : Mainly code to start a browser is written here 
}

END {
Code will get executed in the end  : Mainly code to quit browser is written here 
}

NOTE : We can use indiviadually BEGIN &  END as well.
